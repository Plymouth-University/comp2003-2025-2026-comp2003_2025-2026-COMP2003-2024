Team Meeting Minutes – Sprint 2 Internal Meeting
Project: A Walk in the Park – Mobile Game Adaptation
 Date: Friday, 21/11/2025
 Attendees: Ayush, Connor, Cristian
 Type: Internal Sprint 2 discussion

1. Purpose of Meeting
To discuss the idea on how to go for implementaion.


To discuss the grid & tile placement logic for implementation in Unity.


To agree on next tasks before the Sprint 2 review with the module teacher.



2. Progress Update
Unity project has been created and initial structure set up.


Menu UI and basic gameplay UI layout discussed.


Tile placeholders and Home tile prefab still researching


Trello board reorganised with Sprint 1, Sprint 2, and Blocked items.


Client meeting minutes have been documented and uploaded.



3. Discussion – Grid & Tile Placement Logic
The team discussed how the grid and tile placement system will work in Unity, based on the client’s rules:
Grid
The board will be a 20×20 grid for the MVP.


The grid will be represented using a 2D array.


Each grid cell stores whether it contains a tile or is empty.


Home Tile
A Home Tile will always be placed automatically at the centre of the grid on game start.


This will act as the starting point for all course-building.


Tile Placement
When the player clicks/taps the board:


Convert screen position → world → grid coordinates.


Check if the grid cell is in bounds.


Check if the cell is empty.


For now: allow placement anywhere inside the board for demo.


Later: add adjacency rules, edge matching, path validation, etc.


Tile Rotation
Tile rotation will be handled using 0/90/180/270 degrees.


Rotation will affect the tile’s path edges.


Legal Moves (Future Enhancement)
The same logic will later be used to show “legal placement hints” on the grid.




4. Risks / Blocked Items
Waiting for final physical board game and full rule document from client.


Guest movement and scoring logic will remain blocked until rules are complete.


Multiplayer & leaderboard features are planned for later sprints.



5. Next Steps
Prepare a working demo showing:


20×20 grid


Home tile in center


Click-to-place tile
Further discussion and starting the implementation after getting the physical game and layout, how exactly it looks like and complete the tasks for sprint 2.
